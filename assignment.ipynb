    "**Q3.** This is a question about linear regression. The outcome is whether a defendant is held pre-trial in the Virginia justice system. We would like to understand how that outcome is predicted by characteristics of the defendant, particularly race. Let's be very careful/clear: We aren't saying anyone *should* be held without bond or asserting that people with different demographic variables *should* be more likely to be held, but instead trying to predict whether people with different characteristics *are empirically more likely* to be held without bond, given the available information. This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones? (There are Native American defendants, but there are 11 in total, which is such a small number of observations that is difficult to clearly say anything about how this group is treated relative to the others.)\n",
